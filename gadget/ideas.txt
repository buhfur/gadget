GOING TO WRITE DOWN SOME GADGET IDEAS.
WHAT IS A GADGET?

a tool to complete a certain task

what tasks do i go through? what kind of tools can make this job easier?

homework - scheduler

waking up - alarm clock

time management -

getting to class -

charging my phone -

carrying items from one class to another - app that can keep track of all items in a bag or backpack

ideas - app for adding ideas and keeping track of them

FIXED THE PROBLEM!


now on to the next feature of the program which is to have the user edit one of their ideas
or have the user display all of their ideas

i also should add the project to github

other features i plan to implement:
    -have the user upload a sketch or picture about their idea
    -have the user create an account
    -send a sketch / idea to someone via email or even text!
    -have the users ideas backed up to dropbox
