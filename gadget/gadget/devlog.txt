problem with line 49 with redirecting the user to a url with arguments
positional argument problem

trying to use list as a parameter in jinja
problem with the template to iterate over the list


i think i have found a solution, turning the list into a dictionary as i couldent find any information
regarding regular lists in jinja, going to try out the dict option

figured out i have to .format()
