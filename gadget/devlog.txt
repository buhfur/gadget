problem with line 49 with redirecting the user to a url with arguments
positional argument problem

trying to use list as a parameter in jinja
problem with the template to iterate over the list


i think i have found a solution, turning the list into a dictionary as i couldent find any information
regarding regular lists in jinja, going to try out the dict option

figured out i have to .format()


POSSIBLE CHANGES:
need to figure out how to reroute the user without having all the data within the url
can i encrypt the data in the url if it cant be hidden?


update: 4/9/18

i plan on learning css for a little bit so my web app doesnt look like craigslist when its  finished
- i still havent been able to figure out how to not have all the data within the url
- plan on learning sessions in flask so users can have register an account and keep track of their own ideas
- or should i just leave all ideas public?
-still regardless i need to learn about sessions for future web apps
- since i never plan on switching frameworks and sticking with flask and not django
